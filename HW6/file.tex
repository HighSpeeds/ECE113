\section*{Problem 1}
\subsection*{(a)}
We have $10000\cdot 5$ samples for our 
time domain signal, each of these will be $4$ bytes, 
so in total we would have that we would need 200kB to 
naively represent the signal. For our 
DFT signal we would have $10000 \cdot 5$ samples, each of
which would take $8$ bytes to represent, so in total 
we would need 400kB to represent the signal.
\subsection*{(b)}
Since it is a real value signal we would have that 
$$X_k=X_{N-k}^*$$
Thus we can only send half of the DFT signal,
which would be $10000 \cdot 5/2+1$ samples, each of which
would take $8$ bytes to represent, so in total we would
need 200kB to represent the signal.
\subsection*{(c)}
Then we would have that we would only 
need to send the values of 
$X_k$ between $k=2000$ and $k=4000$, which would be
$2001$ samples, each of which would take $8$ bytes to
represent, so in total we would need 16008 bytes to
represent the signal.
\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
From nyquist we would need to sample at least $2\cdot 8000$ Hz, 
so then we would need $2\cdot 8000\cdot 5=80000$ bytes to represent
the signal in discrete time. Likewise we would need $80001$ bytes 
to represent the signal in the frequency domain since the signal is discrete.
\subsection*{(b)}
We have that the sampled signal's frequency domain is 
$$X_s=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{k=\infty}X(f-kf_s)$$
Where $X(f)$ is the frequency domain of the original signal, then 
since we have that $X(f)>0$ only for $f\in[4000,8000]$, 
then we get that if we just apply a  bandpass filter, we 
can sample at $4000$ Hz and still reconstruct the signal. so 
therefore we would only need $4000\cdot 8=32000$ bytes to represent
the signal in discrete time.
